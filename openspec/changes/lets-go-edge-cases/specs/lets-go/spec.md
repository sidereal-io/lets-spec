## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Review plan runs as a step, or is not in the route
When the schema is `lets-minimal`, review plan never runs. `lets-go` SHALL print `Skipped review plan: not in the lets-minimal route.` after the plan step is done, and before the build step. That line SHALL carry no date. When the schema is not `lets-minimal`, review plan SHALL be a step of its own. It SHALL run as *Each step runs through lets delegate step* says, with `--for review-plan` and `--name <name>-review-plan`. Its prompt SHALL say to invoke the `lets-review-plan` skill for the change, as *The step prompt says what to run, the level, and how to report* says. That skill reviews the plan, or lets its *Check an earlier review* decide, runs its own rounds, and records the review in the pull request description under **Plan review**. When the walk reaches review plan, the first of these that matches SHALL decide whether it is done. First, on `lets-minimal`, review plan is done. Second, when the archive folder exists, review plan is done, and the records disagree when the pull request's body has no **Plan review** section with a `Reviewed:` line and a `- **Verdict:**` line. Third, otherwise, review plan SHALL count as done when that section covers the plan: `lets-review-plan`'s *Check an earlier review* finds no reason to run the skill again, and says the review is finished. When the walk reaches review plan and no section covers the plan, review plan SHALL run, whatever the change's `state`. So a `ready` change with no covering review goes to review plan, not build. `lets-go` SHALL read the pull request's body when it reaches the row, with `gh pr view <name> --json number,body`, because a step in this run can have opened or changed it. When review plan was done before this run, `lets-go` SHALL print `Skipped review plan: the Plan review in pull request #<pr> says <verdict> for <sha>, committed <date>.` `<pr>` SHALL be the pull request's number. `<sha>` and `<verdict>` SHALL come from the **Plan review** section of the pull request's body. `lets-go` SHALL find the `## Plan review` heading first, and read the section up to the next `## ` heading or the end of the body. Inside it, `<sha>` SHALL come from the line that starts `Reviewed: `, and `<verdict>` from the line that starts `- **Verdict:** `. `<date>` SHALL be `<sha>`'s author date, as `YYYY-MM-DD`, from `git log -1 --format=%as <sha>`. When the review plan step reports `done` in this run, `lets-go` SHALL print `Done review plan: <date>. <evidence>`, with the report's `date` and its `evidence` joined with `; `, as for any other step. The schema SHALL be the `schema:` line of the first of these files that exists: the change's `openspec/changes/<name>/.openspec.yaml`, then the archived change's `openspec/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/.openspec.yaml`. When neither exists, it SHALL be the route's schema. So an archived change keeps the schema it was built with, even when the route would now pick another.

#### Scenario: A chore's route
- **WHEN** the schema is `lets-minimal` and the plan step reports `done`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped review plan: not in the lets-minimal route.` and goes on to build

#### Scenario: A review that ran in this run
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, the walk reached review plan with no **Plan review** section in pull request #167, and the review plan step reported `done` with the date `2026-11-05T10:00:00Z` and the evidence `Plan review: APPROVE for 7d16565` and `pull request #167`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Done review plan: 2026-11-05T10:00:00Z. Plan review: APPROVE for 7d16565; pull request #167` before it runs build

#### Scenario: A schema with a review
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, pull request #167's **Plan review** section says `Reviewed: 7d16565` and `- **Verdict:** APPROVE` and covers the plan, and `git log -1 --format=%as 7d16565` prints `2026-11-03`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped review plan: the Plan review in pull request #167 says APPROVE for 7d16565, committed 2026-11-03.` and runs no review plan step

#### Scenario: A ready change with no review
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, the state is `ready`, and the pull request's body has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** the next step to run is review plan, with `--for review-plan`, and build runs only after it reports `done`

#### Scenario: A stale review
- **WHEN** the **Plan review** section says `Reviewed: 7d16565` and `- **Verdict:** APPROVE`, and a later commit changed `design.md` that no rebuttal names
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs the review plan step, whose `lets-review-plan` runs a new round

#### Scenario: The body is read when the row is reached
- **WHEN** the plan step reported `done` in this run, and its brainstorm opened the pull request
- **THEN** `lets-go` reads the body with `gh pr view <name> --json number,body` when it reaches review plan, not from the read before the plan step

#### Scenario: An archived change on lets-minimal
- **WHEN** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-11-04-lets-go-chore/.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-minimal`, the issue's Size has since changed to M so that the route would pick `lets-standard`, and pull request #167's body has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped review plan: not in the lets-minimal route.`, and prints no `Records disagree:` line for the missing section

### Requirement: lets-go relays a needs-input report at the recommend level
When a report's outcome is `needs-input`, `lets-go` SHALL go through its questions in order. For a question with a `recommendation`, it SHALL take the recommendation as the answer, and tell the user the question and the answer it gave. It SHALL write that answer as the recommendation followed by ` (lets-go accepted the step's recommendation; the user did not decide)`. For a question without one, it SHALL ask the user that question alone, and wait for the answer before the next. It SHALL append every pair, in order, to `.workspace/lets-go/<session>-answers.yaml`. That file is a YAML list of `question` and `answer` mappings, and keeps the pairs of earlier rounds. `lets-go` SHALL then run the step again with the same `--prompt-file` and `--answers-file <that file>`, through the same `step instructions`, `step run` and exit 3 rules.

The rounds at `recommend` SHALL have a limit. From a step's sixth `needs-input` report in a run, `lets-go` SHALL relay every question of that step as at `ask`: it SHALL ask the user each one, show the recommendation as the suggested answer, and write the answer as the user gave it, with no marker. Before the first such question, it SHALL print `Interactivity: ask for the rest of this step, because it asked for input five times.` once. The count SHALL be per step and per run: a new run, or another step, starts again at none.

#### Scenario: A mixed report
- **WHEN** the plan step reports `needs-input` with `Which schema?` recommended `lets-minimal`, then `Confirm the ledger?` with no recommendation
- **THEN** `lets-go` tells the user it answered `Which schema?` with `lets-minimal`, asks the user `Confirm the ledger?`, writes both pairs to the answers file with the first marked as accepted by `lets-go`, and runs `step run --for plan` again with `--answers-file .workspace/lets-go/lets-go-chore-plan-answers.yaml`

#### Scenario: A second round
- **WHEN** the resumed step reports `needs-input` with one new question
- **THEN** the answers file holds the earlier pairs and the new one, in order, and the step runs a third time with it

#### Scenario: A step that keeps asking
- **WHEN** the level is `recommend`, and the build step reports `needs-input` for the sixth time in this run, with `Which flag name?` recommended `--quiet`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask for the rest of this step, because it asked for input five times.`, asks the user `Which flag name?` with `--quiet` as the suggested answer, and writes the user's answer with no marker

#### Scenario: The fifth round is still answered
- **WHEN** the level is `recommend`, and the build step reports `needs-input` for the fifth time in this run, with every question recommended
- **THEN** `lets-go` takes each recommendation as the answer, as for the first round, and prints no `Interactivity:` line

### Requirement: A run ends on done, failed, or a repeated question
`lets-go` SHALL run a step's rounds until its report is `done` or `failed`. At `recommend`, from a step's sixth `needs-input` report in a run, the user answers every question of that step, as *lets-go relays a needs-input report at the recommend level* says. When a `needs-input` report holds a question that is already in the answers file, `lets-go` SHALL stop, say the step asked a settled question again, and show the report. *Read the report* SHALL handle a failed shape step before any other failed step. For a failed shape step there is no branch: `lets-go` SHALL print `Failed shape: <reason>`, say to run `lets-shape` on the idea or the issue, name no branch and print no pull request URL. On a `failed` report from any other step it SHALL show the reason, name the step and the branch, and stop. It SHALL say that running `lets-go` again on the branch carries on from the first unfinished step. It SHALL print the pull request's URL only when the branch has a pull request. When it has none, it SHALL print no URL, and SHALL say that the branch has no pull request yet. It SHALL not run a failed step again in the same run.

#### Scenario: A failed apply
- **WHEN** the build step reports `failed` with reason `tests fail on main`
- **THEN** `lets-go` shows `tests fail on main`, names `build` and the branch, says to run `lets-go` again on the branch, and runs no review build

#### Scenario: A repeated question
- **WHEN** the resumed plan step asks `Which schema?` again, and that question is in the answers file
- **THEN** `lets-go` stops and says the step asked a settled question again

#### Scenario: A failed shape
- **WHEN** the shape step reports `failed`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Failed shape:` with the reason, says to run `lets-shape`, names no branch, prints no pull request URL, and runs no plan

#### Scenario: A failed plan with no pull request
- **WHEN** the plan step reports `failed` on the branch `lets-go-chore` before its brainstorm opened a pull request, and `gh pr view lets-go-chore` finds none
- **THEN** `lets-go` names `plan` and `lets-go-chore`, says the branch has no pull request yet, and prints no URL

#### Scenario: The shape case comes first
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Read the report* in `skills/lets-go/SKILL.md`
- **THEN** the case for a failed shape step comes before the case for any other failed step

### Requirement: lets-go takes one issue number or an idea
`lets-go` SHALL take one issue number, or an idea in words, or nothing. A request names an issue when it holds `#<i>` or is a bare number. A leading or trailing `ask` or `recommend` SHALL name the level when the rest of the request is a number or nothing. When the rest is words on the default branch, `lets-go` SHALL ask the user whether that word names the level or is part of the idea, and show both readings. It SHALL ask at either level, before *Start from an idea* runs. Only when the user says the word names the level SHALL `lets-go` take it off, as the level. Otherwise the word SHALL stay in the idea, and *Set the level* SHALL take the level from its next source. On the default branch, every other request with words SHALL be the idea, kept word for word. When the idea holds no letter or digit, in any script, `lets-go` SHALL say that an idea needs at least one letter or digit, and stop. It SHALL stop before the discovery query and the title search, claiming nothing and running no step. On the default branch, when the request holds neither a number nor words, `lets-go` SHALL take `next`: the third case of *Find the source of demand*, over the whole backlog. That case keeps its rank, and its *Check the prerequisite* and *Confirm the packet* on each candidate, as *Only an idea or a named issue goes to the shape step* says. `lets-go` SHALL print `Picked #<i>: <title>, the next ready issue.` and go on from the blocker read with that issue as `<i>`. When the case returns `nothing-ready`, `lets-go` SHALL say the backlog has nothing ready, suggest the `lets-shape` skill, and stop, claiming nothing. On a change's branch, when it is given no number, it SHALL find the issue by the branch name. It SHALL run `gh issue list --state open --search "<branch> in:title" --json number,title` and keep the issues whose title starts with `<branch> — `. Exactly one match SHALL be the issue. Otherwise it SHALL say that it needs the issue number, and stop. When it is given a number on a change's branch, that issue's title SHALL start with `<branch> — `. If it does not, `lets-go` SHALL say the issue and the branch do not match, and stop. When it is given words on a change's branch, it SHALL say that an idea needs the default branch, and stop. It SHALL take an issue number as *Find the source of demand* takes a named issue. It SHALL take an idea as that section takes described work.

#### Scenario: Neither a number nor words
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` alone on the default branch, and `next` finds `#149 lets-go-chore — ...` as the first ready issue
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Picked #149: lets-go-chore — ..., the next ready issue.` and goes on to its blocker read with #149

#### Scenario: Nothing is ready
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` alone on the default branch, and no Todo issue is unassigned, unblocked and ready
- **THEN** `lets-go` says the backlog has nothing ready, suggests `lets-shape`, and claims nothing

#### Scenario: An issue number
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` for `#149`
- **THEN** `lets-go` reads issue `#149` as *Find the source of demand* does for a named issue

#### Scenario: An idea
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets sync` on the default branch
- **THEN** `lets-go` takes `add a --quiet flag to lets sync` as the idea, and searches for an existing issue as *Find the source of demand* does for described work

#### Scenario: An idea with a level
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go recommend add a --quiet flag to lets sync` on the default branch, and answers that `recommend` names the level
- **THEN** the idea is `add a --quiet flag to lets sync`, and the level is `recommend`

#### Scenario: A level word that is part of the idea
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go ask before deleting the branch` on the default branch, and answers that `ask` is part of the idea
- **THEN** the idea is `ask before deleting the branch`, and *Set the level* takes the level from `go.level` or the Kind

#### Scenario: A level with a number
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go ask #149`
- **THEN** the level is `ask`, the issue is `#149`, and `lets-go` asks no question about the word

#### Scenario: An idea with no letters or digits
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go ???` on the default branch
- **THEN** `lets-go` says that an idea needs at least one letter or digit, and stops, claiming nothing, before the discovery query and the title search

#### Scenario: Letters in another script
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go ログを直す` on the default branch
- **THEN** the idea is `ログを直す`, and the run goes to *Start from an idea*

#### Scenario: No issue number on a change's branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` with no issue number on the branch `lets-go-chore`, and one open issue's title starts with `lets-go-chore — `
- **THEN** `lets-go` takes that issue as `<i>`

#### Scenario: Two issues match the branch
- **WHEN** two open issues have titles that start with `lets-go-chore — `
- **THEN** `lets-go` says it needs the issue number, and stops

#### Scenario: The number does not match the branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` for `#149` on the branch `step-strategy`, and #149's title does not start with `step-strategy — `
- **THEN** `lets-go` says the issue and the branch do not match, and stops

#### Scenario: Words on a change's branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go fix the typo in the README` on the branch `lets-go-chore`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says an idea needs the default branch, runs no step, and stops

### Requirement: An entry table says where the run goes after the request
*Read the request* SHALL hold a table that decides where the run goes, from the branch the run started on and the request. Its rows SHALL be the default branch and another branch. Its columns SHALL be a number, an idea and nothing. Each of the six cells SHALL name the part the run goes to next, or the stop:

- On the default branch, a number goes to *Check the issue*. An idea goes to *Start from an idea*. Nothing runs `next`: a pick prints `Picked #<i>: <title>, the next ready issue.` and goes to *Check the issue*, and an empty backlog stops.
- On another branch, a number goes to *Check the issue* when it is one of the open issues whose title starts with the branch's name and ` — `, and stops otherwise. An idea stops: an idea needs the default branch. Nothing goes to *Check the issue* when exactly one open issue's title starts that way, and stops when none or several do.

The table SHALL replace the bullets *Start* step 2 held, with the same results. A leading or trailing `ask` or `recommend` SHALL be read before the table decides, as *lets-go takes one issue number or an idea* says. On another branch, words stop the run, so `lets-go` SHALL ask no question about the word there.

#### Scenario: An idea on the default branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets sync` on `main`, the default branch
- **THEN** the entry table sends the run to *Start from an idea*

#### Scenario: An idea on a change's branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag` on the branch `lets-go-chore`
- **THEN** the entry table stops the run, and `lets-go` says that an idea needs the default branch

#### Scenario: Nothing on a change's branch with one match
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` with nothing on the branch `lets-go-chore`, and one open issue's title starts `lets-go-chore — `
- **THEN** the entry table sends the run to *Check the issue* for that issue

#### Scenario: The table has six cells
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Read the request* in `skills/lets-go/SKILL.md`
- **THEN** it finds a table with a row for the default branch and a row for another branch, and a column each for a number, an idea and nothing
