## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The shape step shapes an idea or an unshaped issue
`lets-go` SHALL run a step named `shape` when the request is an idea that no existing issue matches. It SHALL also run it when *Confirm the packet* returns `needs-shape` for an issue the user named, as *Only an idea or a named issue goes to the shape step* says. It SHALL run that step as *Each step runs through lets delegate step* says, with `--for shape`, on the default branch, before any branch or change exists. The shape step SHALL run at most once per run. After it, a `needs-shape` result SHALL make `lets-go` say to run `lets-shape` on `#<i>`, and stop. `<shape-name>` SHALL be `issue-<i>` for an existing issue, and `idea-<slug>` for an idea. `<slug>` SHALL be built this way: split the idea on white space; lower-case each word; keep only its letters and digits; drop a word left empty; join the first five words with hyphens, or all of them when there are fewer. Once the shape step reports `done` or `failed`, `lets-go` SHALL remove `.workspace/lets-go/<shape-name>-shape-answers.yaml`. Before it writes the shape prompt for an idea, when `.workspace/lets-go/<shape-name>-shape-prompt.md` exists and holds another idea, `lets-go` SHALL remove that answers file too. The shape prompt SHALL say to run `lets-shape`'s *Shape one issue* to its end, including its second comment fetch, its reply, and its glossary handoff. For an idea, it SHALL give the idea word for word. It SHALL say that Start has searched and the user confirmed no open issue is the same work, so the step skips the search and creates the issue. For an existing issue, it SHALL name `#<i>` and say to shape it. It SHALL say to create no change and no change branch, and to end on the default branch with a clean tree, except the discovery maps, `openspec/discovery.md` and the files under `openspec/discovery/`, when discovery ran; a glossary holding branch that `lets-shape` makes is allowed. It SHALL say that the packet confirmation is a confirmation question, with no recommendation. It SHALL say what the first evidence line of a `done` report is: `issue #<i>: <title>` for one issue. When discovery filed stories, it is `epic #<parent>: <title>`, followed by `story #<story>: <title>` lines. It SHALL say that work too large for one issue, Size L or XL, or an input that holds a large idea, ends the round with the discovery question, as *The shape step asks before it runs discovery* says. When the step reports `done` for one issue, `lets-go` SHALL read `<i>` from that first evidence line. When it reports `done` for a parent and stories, `lets-go` SHALL pick `<i>` as *lets-go picks the first ready story* says. A `done` report whose first evidence line is in neither form SHALL count as `failed`, with a reason that says the shape step named no issue. After a `done` report, Start SHALL go on from its blocker read with `<i>`, as for an issue number, and the shape line SHALL be `Done shape: <date>. <evidence>`. When the step reports `failed`, `lets-go` SHALL print `Failed shape: <reason>`, say to run `lets-shape` on the idea or the issue, name no branch, and stop. When exit 3 sends the step to a subagent, the subagent SHALL work on the default branch.

#### Scenario: An idea no issue matches
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets sync`, and the search finds no open issue
- **THEN** `lets-go` writes `.workspace/lets-go/idea-add-a-quiet-flag-to-shape-prompt.md`, and runs `lets delegate step run --for shape --name idea-add-a-quiet-flag-to-shape`

#### Scenario: A short idea with punctuation
- **WHEN** the idea is `fix lets-sync — quiet output`
- **THEN** `<shape-name>` is `idea-fix-letssync-quiet-output`: the dash alone is dropped, and four words are all there are

#### Scenario: The shape prompt for an idea
- **WHEN** `lets-go` writes the shape prompt for the idea `add a --quiet flag to lets sync`
- **THEN** the file names `lets-shape`, holds `add a --quiet flag to lets sync`, says the search has run and to create the issue, says to run *Shape one issue* to its end and finish on the default branch with a clean tree, and says the first evidence line is `issue #<i>: <title>`

#### Scenario: The shape prompt names discovery
- **WHEN** `lets-go` writes the shape prompt
- **THEN** the file holds `Run discovery on it?`, `epic #<parent>: <title>`, `story #<story>: <title>`, `Discovery status: in-progress`, `openspec/discovery.md` and `openspec/discovery/`, and does not say to end with a failed report for a too-large idea

#### Scenario: The answers file after shape
- **WHEN** the shape step for `idea-add-a-quiet-flag-to` reports `done`, and `.workspace/lets-go/idea-add-a-quiet-flag-to-shape-answers.yaml` holds three pairs
- **THEN** `lets-go` removes that file before it goes on, so a later idea with the same first five words starts with no answers

#### Scenario: Another idea with the same first five words
- **WHEN** a run for `add a --quiet flag to lets sync` stopped at `needs-input`, and the user now runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets status`
- **THEN** `lets-go` removes `.workspace/lets-go/idea-add-a-quiet-flag-to-shape-answers.yaml` before it writes the prompt, and the first round carries no `--answers-file`

#### Scenario: Confirm the packet stops after shape
- **WHEN** the shape step reported `done` for #181 in this run, and *Confirm the packet* then returns `needs-shape` because #181 has no Kind
- **THEN** `lets-go` says to run `lets-shape` on #181, stops, and runs no second shape step

#### Scenario: An issue with no packet
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` for `#180`, no branch for its change exists, and *Confirm the packet* returns `needs-shape` because #180 has no Kind
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs the shape step with `--name issue-180-shape`, and its prompt says to shape #180

#### Scenario: The shape step is done
- **WHEN** the shape step reports `done` with the first evidence line `issue #181: lets-sync-quiet — lets sync takes a --quiet flag` and the date `2026-11-05T09:30:00Z`
- **THEN** `lets-go` takes `#181` as `<i>`, reads its blockers, and confirms its packet. It prints `Done shape: 2026-11-05T09:30:00Z. issue #181: lets-sync-quiet — lets sync takes a --quiet flag`, and goes on to *Route*

#### Scenario: A done report that names no issue
- **WHEN** the shape step reports `done` and its first evidence line is `created the issue`
- **THEN** `lets-go` treats the step as `failed`, with a reason that says the shape step named no issue, and stops

#### Scenario: An idea too large for one issue
- **WHEN** the shape step sizes the idea XL
- **THEN** it ends the round with the discovery question instead of a `failed` report, and `lets-go` prints no `Failed shape:` line

#### Scenario: An issue that holds a large idea
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` for `#180`, whose body is a two-page vision with no packet, and the shape step finds it holds a large idea
- **THEN** the step's report is `needs-input` with the discovery question, and on `yes` discovery runs with #180 as its input, which stays open as `lets-shape` leaves it

#### Scenario: The shape step in a subagent
- **WHEN** `step run --for shape` exits 3 and its stderr names `.workspace/lets-delegate/idea-add-a-quiet-flag-to-shape.prompt.md`
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs a subagent with that prompt file on the default branch, and reads its `step-report` block

### Requirement: lets-go commits the discovery map on the story's branch
Discovery edits the discovery maps in the working tree on the default branch: `openspec/discovery.md`, and in a repository with several products the files under `openspec/discovery/`. Before it runs the shape step, `lets-go` SHALL run `git status --porcelain`. When that lists `openspec/discovery.md` or a path under `openspec/discovery/`, `lets-go` SHALL look for an open parent issue that says `Discovery status: in-progress` and whose `Input:` line names this input. When one exists, the edits are that discovery's confirmed phases, and `lets-go` SHALL go on and run the shape step, which resumes it. When none exists, `lets-go` SHALL say the maps have uncommitted edits, name each path, say to commit or discard them, and stop. The shape step SHALL end on the default branch with the tree clean, except the discovery maps when discovery ran. When the shape step ran in this run and *Claim* created the picked story's branch, `lets-go` SHALL commit every discovery map path that `git status --porcelain` lists, new and moved files included, on the branch, before *lets-go walks the step table* reads the tree. The commit is `git add` of those paths and one `docs:` commit whose message is `docs: the discovery map from #<parent>`. `<parent>` is the parent's number, or the story's when the parent became the one story. It SHALL commit no other path. When no discovery map changed, or no shape step ran in this run, it SHALL make no commit. When the run stops after discovery and before *Claim*, `lets-go` SHALL say that the discovery maps it names hold the discovery's edits, uncommitted on the default branch. While the parent still says `Discovery status: in-progress`, it SHALL say to leave the maps as they are, because running `lets-go` again with the same input resumes the discovery and keeps its edits. Otherwise, it SHALL say to commit or discard them before the next run, because a run stops on a dirty tree.

#### Scenario: The map is committed
- **WHEN** discovery changed `openspec/discovery.md`, and *Claim* created the branch `plugin-contract`
- **THEN** `lets-go` commits `openspec/discovery.md` alone on `plugin-contract` as `docs: the discovery map from #190`, and `git status --porcelain` then lists no path outside `.workspace/`

#### Scenario: A new map
- **WHEN** the project had no `openspec/discovery.md` and discovery created it
- **THEN** `lets-go` commits the new file the same way

#### Scenario: The run stops before Claim
- **WHEN** no story is ready, and `openspec/discovery.md` is modified
- **THEN** `lets-go` says the map is uncommitted on the default branch, says to commit or discard it before the next run, and commits nothing

#### Scenario: A dirty map before the shape step
- **WHEN** `git status --porcelain` lists ` M openspec/discovery.md` before the shape step runs, and no open parent issue for this input says `Discovery status: in-progress`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says the map has uncommitted edits, says to commit or discard them, and runs no step

#### Scenario: A dirty map from the discovery it resumes
- **WHEN** a run for `rewrite the backlog around a plugin model` stopped after Personas was confirmed, `git status --porcelain` lists ` M openspec/discovery.md`, and the open parent `Epic: plugin backlog` says `Discovery status: in-progress` with `Input: rewrite the backlog around a plugin model`
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs the shape step, which resumes the parent at the journey map, and the map commit after *Claim* takes the edits

#### Scenario: A later run with no shape step
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go #191` after the map was committed by hand, #191's packet is complete, and *Claim* creates the branch
- **THEN** `lets-go` makes no map commit

#### Scenario: A discovery that fits one story
- **WHEN** discovery edited the map and the parent became story #190, and *Claim* created #190's branch
- **THEN** `lets-go` commits the map as `docs: the discovery map from #190`

#### Scenario: A product's map and the root
- **WHEN** discovery moved the old map to `openspec/discovery/web-shop.md`, rewrote `openspec/discovery.md` as the root, and created `openspec/discovery/warehouse.md`, and *Claim* created the branch `stock-alerts`
- **THEN** `lets-go` commits those three paths, and no other, on `stock-alerts` in one commit, `docs: the discovery map from #<parent>`

#### Scenario: A dirty product map before the shape step
- **WHEN** `git status --porcelain` lists ` M openspec/discovery/warehouse.md` before the shape step runs, and no open parent issue for this input says `Discovery status: in-progress`
- **THEN** `lets-go` names `openspec/discovery/warehouse.md`, says to commit or discard it, and runs no step
