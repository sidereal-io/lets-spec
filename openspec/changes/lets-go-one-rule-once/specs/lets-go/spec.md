## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Start finds, confirms, routes and claims the issue
`lets-go` SHALL hold *Find the source of demand*, *Confirm the packet*, *Route*, *Glossary preflight*, *Claim* and *Import the glossary checkpoint* as sections of its own. They SHALL sit under no `## Start` heading: the parts that *lets-go opens with an overview of its parts* lists call them. It SHALL name no section of `lets-build`. It SHALL run *Find the source of demand*, *Confirm the packet* and *Route* in its own session on every run. It SHALL run *Claim* only when no branch with the change's name exists, locally or on `origin`. *Check the issue* SHALL be the only part that looks for the branch: *Claim* SHALL not look again, and SHALL have no `branch-exists` result. When a branch with the change's name appears after *Check the issue* looked, creating it fails, and *Claim* SHALL release the claim and return `branch-failed`. *Claim* sets the issue's Status with `gh project item-edit`, so `lets-go` sets that field itself. When the change's branch exists and `lets-go` is on the default branch, it SHALL run `git switch <name>`, and go on as on a change's branch. On a change's branch that `origin` has, it SHALL run `git fetch origin <name>` before it reads any record. A local branch behind `origin/<name>` SHALL be fast-forwarded with `git merge --ff-only origin/<name>`. A local branch that has diverged from `origin/<name>` is a disagreement. `lets-go` SHALL read the issue's blockers, and decide on an open one, before it runs *Find the source of demand* for that issue. The skill SHALL state this rule before that call, so that an agent that follows it in reading order decides on an open blocker before it reaches the section. The blocker read SHALL be `gh issue view <i> --json title,blockedBy`, so the change's name is known as *Claim* names it, before *Confirm the packet* reads the title. `lets-go` SHALL look for the change's branch as *lets-go looks for the change's branch before the packet check* says. When a blocker is open and the branch exists, locally or on `origin`, it SHALL name the open blockers and go on: the user has stacked the branch by hand. *Find the source of demand* SHALL still run *Check the prerequisite* for the issue. When it returns `unresolved`, `lets-go` SHALL report the unresolved owner or checkpoint, and stop, even on a stacked branch. When a blocker is open and no such branch exists, `lets-go` SHALL say which open issues block it, and stop. The first case of *Find the source of demand*, for an issue the run already has, SHALL make no blocker decision of its own, because the blocker read has decided. That case SHALL cover an issue the user named, and an issue the run picked or shaped. Its heading SHALL not say the user named it: whether the user named it matters only to the shape step. Each procedure returns a result, and the part that ran it decides what comes next, as *Each lets-go procedure returns a result* says. *Check the issue* holds the blocker read. For an idea, `lets-go` SHALL run that section's second case, described work with no issue: the search for an existing issue. It SHALL show the user the matches and ask, at either level, whether one is the same work. A yes SHALL make that issue `<i>`. On a no, or when the case returns `no-match`, `lets-go` SHALL run the shape step for the idea. With no number and no idea, `lets-go` SHALL run that section's third case, `next`, as *lets-go takes one issue number or an idea* says. After a shape report that names a parent and stories, `lets-go` SHALL run that third case again. The candidates SHALL be the report's stories, as *lets-go picks the first ready story* says. When *Claim* returns `taken`, `lets-go` SHALL go on as *A lost claim drops the issue, and three lost claims stop the run* says. When *Confirm the packet* returns `needs-shape`, `lets-go` SHALL go on as *Only an idea or a named issue goes to the shape step* says. When it returns `epic`, `lets-go` SHALL say that an epic is built through its stories, list its open sub-issues, and stop. Beside the commands those sections hold, the parts before *Walk the step table* SHALL run only:

- `lets go level`, run once when it reads the request, as *lets-go picks the interactivity level and says why* says;
- `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name` and `git branch --show-current`, run once after it, to find the default branch and the current one;
- the Project query, run once in *Read the settings*, as *The Project query runs once per run* says;
- `title` beside `blockedBy` in the blocker read above;
- `gh issue view <i> --json createdAt`, run only when the issue's `lastEditedAt` is null;
- the issue search of *lets-go takes one issue number or an idea*;
- `git branch --list <name>` and `git ls-remote --heads origin refs/heads/<name>`, to find the change's branch, and the fetch, switch and fast-forward above;
- the Git and GitHub reads of *lets-go walks the step table*, *A skipped step's line carries its evidence and date* and *Review plan runs as a step, or is not in the route*. These include the reads of `lets-review-plan`'s *Check an earlier review*, which tell whether review plan is done;
- the in-progress parent query of *A stopped discovery resumes from its parent issue*, run only for an idea;
- the `git status --porcelain` before the shape step, and the commit of `openspec/discovery.md`, that *lets-go commits the discovery map on the story's branch* says.

No part SHALL be a step: the parts before the walk SHALL run no `lets delegate step` command of their own, beside *Run the shape step*, and SHALL produce no step report. The shape step that *Run the shape step* runs is a step, and has a report.

#### Scenario: The skill names the sections
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads `skills/lets-go/SKILL.md`
- **THEN** it finds *Find the source of demand*, *Confirm the packet*, *Route*, *Glossary preflight*, *Claim* and *Import the glossary checkpoint* as headings of `lets-go`. It finds `gh issue view <i> --json createdAt`, `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name` and `gh project item-edit`, and no section named as `lets-build`'s

#### Scenario: A lost race on next
- **WHEN** `lets-go` ran alone, `next` picked #149, and *Claim* finds that #149 has an assignee
- **THEN** `lets-go` leaves #149 out, runs both `next` commands again, prints a new `Picked` line, and runs the blocker read, *Confirm the packet* and *Route* for the new issue

#### Scenario: The branch exists
- **WHEN** `lets-go` runs for #149 on the default branch, and `origin` has a branch `lets-go-chore`
- **THEN** `lets-go` does not run *Claim*, switches to `lets-go-chore`, fetches it, and walks the step table there

#### Scenario: A stale local branch
- **WHEN** the local branch `lets-go-chore` is two commits behind `origin/lets-go-chore`, and has no commit of its own
- **THEN** `lets-go` fast-forwards it before it reads the change state

#### Scenario: Claim fails
- **WHEN** the user named the issue, and *Claim* returns `taken` because someone else has it
- **THEN** `lets-go` says who has it and stops, and runs no step

#### Scenario: A blocked story on its own branch
- **WHEN** `lets-go` runs for #152, which #149 blocks and #149 is open, and the branch `lets-go-story` exists on `origin`
- **THEN** `lets-go` names #149 as an open blocker, switches to `lets-go-story`, and walks the step table there

#### Scenario: A blocked story with no branch
- **WHEN** `lets-go` runs for #152 on the default branch, #149 is open, and no branch `lets-go-story` exists locally or on `origin`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says #149 blocks it, and claims nothing

#### Scenario: A stacked story with an unresolved prerequisite
- **WHEN** `lets-go` runs for #152, which #149 blocks and #149 is open, the branch `lets-go-story` exists on `origin`, and #152's **Glossary handoff** names #150 as the owner of its definitions, and #150's pull request has not merged
- **THEN** `lets-go` names #149 as an open blocker, reports that #150 owns the definitions and has not merged, and stops, and runs no step

#### Scenario: The blocker rule comes before the call
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Check the issue* in `skills/lets-go/SKILL.md`
- **THEN** it finds `gh issue view <i> --json title,blockedBy` before the call to *Find the source of demand*, and that section's named-issue case no longer says `If an open issue blocks it, say so and stop`

#### Scenario: The search finds the same work
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets sync`, the search finds `#181 lets-sync-quiet — lets sync takes a --quiet flag`, and the user says it is the same work
- **THEN** `lets-go` takes `#181` as `<i>`, runs no shape step for the idea, and goes on to the blocker read

#### Scenario: The search finds other work
- **WHEN** the search finds one issue and the user says it is not the same work
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs the shape step for the idea, and does not say to run `lets-shape`

#### Scenario: A packet with unread comments
- **WHEN** the user named #180, no branch for its change exists, and *Confirm the packet* returns `needs-shape` because it finds two comments after the watermark
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs the shape step for #180

#### Scenario: The pick names next
- **WHEN** the shape step reports an epic and three stories
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs its own `next` case, with the three stories as the only candidates, and adds no command of its own for the pick

#### Scenario: A branch made after the check
- **WHEN** *Check the issue* found no branch `lets-go-chore` for #149, and someone creates a local branch `lets-go-chore` before *Claim* creates it
- **THEN** *Claim* fails to create the branch, removes its assignment, sets #149's Status back to Todo and returns `branch-failed`, and `lets-go` shows the error and stops

### Requirement: A complete packet means shape is skipped, and the skip line says when
When *Confirm the packet* returns `complete`, and no shape step ran in this run, `lets-go` SHALL print `Skipped shape: #<i>'s packet is complete, last edited <date>.`, once for that issue. `<date>` SHALL be the day of the issue's `lastEditedAt`, which the thread query in *Confirm the packet* returns, as `YYYY-MM-DD`. When `lastEditedAt` is null, `<date>` SHALL be the day of the issue's `createdAt`, read with `gh issue view <i> --json createdAt`. When *Confirm the packet* returns `complete` after a shape step reported `done` in this run, `lets-go` SHALL print `Done shape: <date>. <evidence>` instead, with the report's `date` and its `evidence` joined with `; `. It SHALL print the `Done shape` line once per run: after a lost claim, *Check the issue* SHALL not print it again for the story picked next. When *Confirm the packet* returns `needs-shape`, `lets-go` SHALL go on as *Only an idea or a named issue goes to the shape step* says, and print no skip line.

#### Scenario: An edited packet
- **WHEN** issue `#149`'s body was last edited on 2026-11-04
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped shape: #149's packet is complete, last edited 2026-11-04.`

#### Scenario: A packet never edited
- **WHEN** the issue's `lastEditedAt` is null and `gh issue view <i> --json createdAt` says it was created on 2026-11-03
- **THEN** the skip line's date is `2026-11-03`

#### Scenario: A packet with a missing line
- **WHEN** the packet lacks its one-line outcome
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints no skip line, and runs the shape step for the issue

#### Scenario: A packet the shape step wrote
- **WHEN** the shape step reported `done` in this run with the date `2026-11-05T09:30:00Z`, and *Confirm the packet* passes for the issue it named
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Done shape: 2026-11-05T09:30:00Z.` followed by the report's evidence, and no `Skipped shape` line

#### Scenario: Done shape after a lost claim
- **WHEN** discovery filed #191 and #192, *Check the issue* printed `Done shape:` for #191, *Claim* returned `taken` for #191, and *Pick the first ready story* then picked #192
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints the `Picked` line for #192, and no second `Done shape:` line

### Requirement: Review plan runs as a step, or is not in the route
When the schema is `lets-minimal`, review plan never runs. `lets-go` SHALL print `Skipped review plan: not in the lets-minimal route.` after the plan step is done, and before the build step. That line SHALL carry no date. When the schema is not `lets-minimal`, review plan SHALL be a step of its own. It SHALL run as *Each step runs through lets delegate step* says, with `--for review-plan` and `--name <name>-review-plan`. Its prompt SHALL say to invoke the `lets-review-plan` skill for the change, as *The step prompt says what to run, the level, and how to report* says. That skill reviews the plan, or lets its *Check an earlier review* decide, runs its own rounds, and records the review in the pull request description under **Plan review**. When the walk reaches review plan, the first of these that matches SHALL decide whether it is done. First, on `lets-minimal`, review plan is done. Second, when the archive folder exists, review plan is done, and the records disagree when the pull request's body has no **Plan review** section with a `Reviewed:` line and a `- **Verdict:**` line. Third, otherwise, review plan SHALL count as done when that section covers the plan: `lets-review-plan`'s *Check an earlier review* finds no reason to run the skill again, and says the review is finished. When the walk reaches review plan and no section covers the plan, review plan SHALL run, whatever the change's `state`. So a `ready` change with no covering review goes to review plan, not build. `lets-go` SHALL read the pull request's body when it reaches the row, with `gh pr view <name> --json number,body`, because a step in this run can have opened or changed it. When review plan was done before this run, `lets-go` SHALL print `Skipped review plan: the Plan review in pull request #<pr> says <verdict> for <sha>, committed <date>.` `<pr>` SHALL be the pull request's number. `<sha>` and `<verdict>` SHALL come from the **Plan review** section of the pull request's body. `lets-go` SHALL find the `## Plan review` heading first, and read the section up to the next `## ` heading or the end of the body. Inside it, `<sha>` SHALL come from the line that starts `Reviewed: `, and `<verdict>` from the line that starts `- **Verdict:** `. `<date>` SHALL be `<sha>`'s author date, as `YYYY-MM-DD`, from `git log -1 --format=%as <sha>`. When the review plan step reports `done` in this run, `lets-go` SHALL print `Done review plan: <date>. <evidence>`, with the report's `date` and its `evidence` joined with `; `, as for any other step. The schema SHALL be the `schema:` line of the change's `.openspec.yaml` when the change folder exists, and the route's schema when it does not.

#### Scenario: A chore's route
- **WHEN** the schema is `lets-minimal` and the plan step reports `done`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped review plan: not in the lets-minimal route.` and goes on to build

#### Scenario: A review that ran in this run
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, the walk reached review plan with no **Plan review** section in pull request #167, and the review plan step reported `done` with the date `2026-11-05T10:00:00Z` and the evidence `Plan review: APPROVE for 7d16565` and `pull request #167`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Done review plan: 2026-11-05T10:00:00Z. Plan review: APPROVE for 7d16565; pull request #167` before it runs build

#### Scenario: A schema with a review
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, pull request #167's **Plan review** section says `Reviewed: 7d16565` and `- **Verdict:** APPROVE` and covers the plan, and `git log -1 --format=%as 7d16565` prints `2026-11-03`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped review plan: the Plan review in pull request #167 says APPROVE for 7d16565, committed 2026-11-03.` and runs no review plan step

#### Scenario: A ready change with no review
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, the state is `ready`, and the pull request's body has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** the next step to run is review plan, with `--for review-plan`, and build runs only after it reports `done`

#### Scenario: A stale review
- **WHEN** the **Plan review** section says `Reviewed: 7d16565` and `- **Verdict:** APPROVE`, and a later commit changed `design.md` that no rebuttal names
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs the review plan step, whose `lets-review-plan` runs a new round

#### Scenario: The body is read when the row is reached
- **WHEN** the plan step reported `done` in this run, and its brainstorm opened the pull request
- **THEN** `lets-go` reads the body with `gh pr view <name> --json number,body` when it reaches review plan, not from the read before the plan step

#### Scenario: An archived change on lets-minimal
- **WHEN** the route's schema is `lets-minimal`, the archive folder `openspec/changes/archive/2026-11-04-lets-go-chore` exists, and pull request #167's body has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Skipped review plan: not in the lets-minimal route.`, and prints no `Records disagree:` line for the missing section

### Requirement: lets-go picks the interactivity level and says why
In *Read the settings*, before it asks GitHub for anything, `lets-go` SHALL run `lets go level` from the repo root, once per run. When the command exits non-zero, `lets-go` SHALL show the user its stderr and stop. It SHALL then claim nothing and run no step. Otherwise it SHALL keep the `level` the command printed for the whole run. Each time it picks the level, it SHALL take the first of these that is set. First, the level the user named in the request. Then the kept `level`, when it is not `null`. Then the Kind's default: `recommend` for a Chore or a Bug, and `ask` for a Story or any other Kind, because *Confirm the packet* reads any other Kind as a Story. It SHALL print the line for the source it used. For the request's level: `Interactivity: <level>, because you asked for it.` For the config's: `Interactivity: <level>, because your lets config sets go.level.` For the Kind's: `Interactivity: <level>, because #<i> is a <Kind>.` Before a shape step, the Kind is not settled. The level for the shape step SHALL be the request's, when named; else the config's, when set; else `ask`. In that last case the line SHALL read `Interactivity: ask, because shape has not run yet.` After the shape step, `lets-go` SHALL pick the level again, in the same order, and print its line. *Set the level* SHALL hold this rule, and *Run the shape step* SHALL link to it, not write it again. `lets-go` SHALL never ask the user which level to use. The level SHALL hold for the whole run and SHALL not be kept for a later run. It SHALL put the level, and what it means for the step, into every step prompt.

#### Scenario: The level line
- **WHEN** issue `#149` is a Chore and Start has passed
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because #149 is a Chore.` before it runs plan

#### Scenario: A Story
- **WHEN** issue `#152` is a Story and Start has passed
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask, because #152 is a Story.` before it runs plan

#### Scenario: A Bug
- **WHEN** the issue is a Bug
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because #<i> is a Bug.` with the issue's number

#### Scenario: The user names the level
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` for `#152`, a Story, and says `recommend`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because you asked for it.` and relays at `recommend`

#### Scenario: A later run
- **WHEN** an earlier run of `lets-go` for `#152` ran at `recommend` because the user said so, and the user runs `lets-go` for `#152` again without naming a level
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask, because #152 is a Story.`

#### Scenario: The shape step's level
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets sync` without naming a level
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask, because shape has not run yet.` before the shape step, and relays its questions at `ask`

#### Scenario: The level after shape
- **WHEN** the shape step wrote `#181` as a Chore, and the user named no level
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because #181 is a Chore.` before it runs plan

#### Scenario: A named level holds through shape
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go recommend add a --quiet flag to lets sync`, and the shape step writes a Story
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because you asked for it.` before the shape step and again before plan

#### Scenario: The config sets the level
- **WHEN** the `lets` config holds `go.level: recommend`, issue `#152` is a Story, the user named no level, and Start has passed
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because your lets config sets go.level.` before it runs plan, and relays at `recommend`

#### Scenario: The request's level beats the config's
- **WHEN** the `lets` config holds `go.level: recommend`, and the user runs `lets-go` for `#152`, a Story, and says `ask`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask, because you asked for it.`

#### Scenario: The config's level before shape
- **WHEN** the `lets` config holds `go.level: recommend`, and the user runs `lets-go add a --quiet flag to lets sync` without naming a level
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: recommend, because your lets config sets go.level.` before the shape step, and again before plan

#### Scenario: The config holds no level
- **WHEN** `lets go level` prints `{"level":null}`, issue `#152` is a Story, and the user named no level
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask, because #152 is a Story.`

#### Scenario: lets go level fails
- **WHEN** the `lets` config holds `go.level: loud`, and the user runs `lets-go` for `#152`
- **THEN** `lets-go` shows the user the command's stderr, which names `go.level`, claims nothing, and runs no step

#### Scenario: Another Kind
- **WHEN** issue `#160` has the Kind Spike on the Project, its packet has every Story line, and the user named no level and the config sets none
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Interactivity: ask, because #160 is a Spike.`

#### Scenario: The rule is written once
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Run the shape step* in `lets-go`
- **THEN** it finds a link to `#set-the-level`, and not the line `Interactivity: <level>, because your lets config sets go.level.`

### Requirement: lets-go walks the step table
After *Set the level*, on the change's branch, `lets-go` SHALL read the records Git and GitHub keep, in this order. First, `git status --porcelain`: a line for a path outside `.workspace/` is a disagreement. Second, the pull request for the branch, with `gh pr view <name> --json number,url,state,isDraft,body`. A missing pull request is noted, not a stop. Third, the archive folder, whose whole name is `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>` in `openspec/changes/archive/`. When it exists, every step is done. Then `lets-go` SHALL walk the step table from the top: plan, review plan, build, review build. The step table SHALL have no row for shape: shape runs before the walk, in *Run the shape step*, and *Check the issue* prints its `Skipped shape` or `Done shape` line. When the walk reaches a row, it SHALL read whether that step is done. Each row's done test SHALL be written once, in the walk, as an ordered list: the first item that matches decides. The step table SHALL not restate it. The plan row and the build row each read the change state when the walk reaches them: `openspec instructions apply --change <name> --json`, run when `openspec/changes/<name>/` exists and there is no archive folder. Plan is done when the `state` is `ready` or `all_done`, or the archive folder exists. Build is done when the `state` is `all_done`, or the archive folder exists. The build row SHALL read the state again, even when the plan row read it, because a review plan round can add a task. Any `state` other than `blocked`, `ready` or `all_done` SHALL show the CLI's `instruction` and stop. Review plan is done as *Review plan runs as a step, or is not in the route* says. Review build is done when the archive folder exists. A done step SHALL print its line, as *A skipped step's line carries its evidence and date* says. An unfinished step SHALL run, as *Each step runs through lets delegate step* says. Its report SHALL be read as *A run ends on done, failed, or a repeated question* says. After a `done` report, the walk SHALL check it as *A done report is checked against its record* says, and go on to the next row only when the check passes. `lets-go` SHALL read a row's record when it reaches the row, not before, because a step run in this round changes the records the next row reads.

#### Scenario: A branch with no change
- **WHEN** the branch `lets-go-chore` has no `openspec/changes/lets-go-chore/` folder and no archive folder
- **THEN** the first step the walk runs is plan, and `lets-go` prints only the shape skip line before it

#### Scenario: A plan in progress
- **WHEN** `openspec instructions apply --change lets-go-chore --json` says `blocked`
- **THEN** the first step the walk runs is plan

#### Scenario: A ready plan
- **WHEN** the state is `ready`, the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, and the pull request's body has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints the shape and plan skip lines, runs review plan, and runs build after review plan reports `done`

#### Scenario: Every task ticked
- **WHEN** the state is `all_done`, and the pull request's **Plan review** section covers the plan
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints four skip lines, then runs review build

#### Scenario: An archived change
- **WHEN** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-11-04-lets-go-chore` exists, and no `openspec/changes/lets-go-chore/` folder does
- **THEN** every step is done, and `lets-go` runs none

#### Scenario: A name that ends another change's name
- **WHEN** the change is `go-chore`, and the archive holds `2026-11-04-lets-go-chore` and no folder `<YYYY-MM-DD>-go-chore`
- **THEN** `lets-go` finds no archive folder for `go-chore`

#### Scenario: A built change whose review is missing
- **WHEN** the state is `all_done`, the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, and the pull request's body has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints the shape and plan skip lines, runs review plan, prints `Skipped build: every task is ticked, last task commit <date> (<sha>).` with the last task commit, and runs review build

#### Scenario: A review round adds a task
- **WHEN** the plan row read `all_done`, the review plan step ran in this run, and its `REVISE` round added an unticked task to `tasks.md` before its `APPROVE`
- **THEN** the build row reads the state again, finds `ready`, and runs build instead of printing `Skipped build:`

#### Scenario: The step table has no done column
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads the step table of `lets-go`
- **THEN** its header has no *Done when* column

### Requirement: A closed pull request ends the run
When the pull request's `state` is `MERGED`, `lets-go` SHALL say the change is merged and the run is finished, and stop. When its `state` is `CLOSED`, `lets-go` SHALL say the change was rejected and there is nothing to resume, and stop. Neither SHALL count as a disagreement, and neither SHALL run a step. The skill SHALL say when these stops run: when the change's branch still exists and the run can find its issue. That happens when a stacked pull request merged into the branch below it, which leaves its issue open, or when the user names a closed issue on the default branch and its branch is still there.

#### Scenario: A merged pull request
- **WHEN** `gh pr view lets-go-chore` says `state` is `MERGED`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says the change is merged, and runs no step

#### Scenario: A rejected pull request
- **WHEN** `gh pr view lets-go-chore` says `state` is `CLOSED`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says the change was rejected, and runs no step

#### Scenario: A stacked pull request merged into its base
- **WHEN** pull request #214 for `lets-go-one-rule-once` merged into `lets-go-procedures-return`, its issue #202 is still open, and the user runs `lets-go` on the branch `lets-go-one-rule-once`
- **THEN** `lets-go` finds #202 by the branch name, reads `MERGED`, says the change is merged, and runs no step

### Requirement: lets-go runs for a Chore, a Bug or a Story
`lets-go` SHALL run on the repository's default branch, or on a change's branch. A change's branch is a branch named after the change, whose issue `lets-go` finds as *lets-go takes one issue number or an idea* says. On any other branch it SHALL say that `lets-go` runs on the default branch or on a change's branch, and stop. It SHALL run for an issue whose Kind is Chore, Bug or Story, for an issue of any other Kind but Epic, which it treats as a Story, and for an idea or an unshaped issue, which the shape step turns into one. It SHALL add no Kind check of its own: an Epic stops where *Confirm the packet* says an epic is built through its stories. For a Story with a parent, it SHALL read the parent's **Shared decisions** as *Confirm the packet* says, because *Route* needs them. When a procedure returns a result that ends the run, such as `unresolved` for a glossary prerequisite, `lets-go` SHALL stop as the part that ran it says.

#### Scenario: A change's branch
- **WHEN** the current branch is `lets-go-chore`, and issue #149's title starts with `lets-go-chore — `
- **THEN** `lets-go` runs for #149 on that branch, and claims nothing

#### Scenario: A Story
- **WHEN** *Confirm the packet* reads the issue's fields and its Kind is Story, and the issue has a parent
- **THEN** `lets-go` reads the parent's **Shared decisions**, runs *Route*, and goes on to the first step

#### Scenario: A Bug
- **WHEN** the issue's Kind is Bug and its packet has every Bug line
- **THEN** `lets-go` goes on to *Route* without reading a parent

#### Scenario: An Epic
- **WHEN** the issue's Kind is Epic
- **THEN** `lets-go` stops as *Confirm the packet* says, lists the epic's open sub-issues, and claims nothing

#### Scenario: A branch with no issue
- **WHEN** the current branch is `fix-typo`, and no open issue's title starts with `fix-typo — `
- **THEN** `lets-go` says it runs on the default branch or on a change's branch, and stops

#### Scenario: A glossary prerequisite still stops
- **WHEN** the issue's **Glossary handoff** names an owner whose pull request has not merged
- **THEN** `lets-go` stops as *Check the prerequisite* says, and runs no step

#### Scenario: Another Kind
- **WHEN** the issue's Kind is Spike, and its packet has every Story line
- **THEN** `lets-go` goes on to *Route*, as for a Story

### Requirement: The Project query runs once per run
`lets-go` SHALL run its Project query once per run, in *Read the settings*, right after it finds the default branch and the current one. The query sets `<project>`, `<owner>` and `<repo>` for the whole run. When it finds no Project, `lets-go` SHALL say to run the `lets-setup-backlog` skill, and stop. When it finds two or more, `lets-go` SHALL list each one's title and URL, ask the user to unlink the extras, and stop. It SHALL never pick one itself. These two stops SHALL come before every other stop of the run but a failed `lets go level`. No other part SHALL hold them. *Find the source of demand* SHALL not run the query, and SHALL return neither `no-project` nor `several-projects`.

#### Scenario: Next, then the named issue
- **WHEN** `lets-go` runs with nothing on the default branch, `next` picks #149, and *Check the issue* runs *Find the source of demand* for #149
- **THEN** the Project query has run once in the run

#### Scenario: No Project
- **WHEN** no Project is linked to the repository, and the user runs `lets-go` on the branch `fix-typo`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says to run the `lets-setup-backlog` skill and stops, before it searches for the branch's issue

#### Scenario: Two Projects
- **WHEN** two open Projects are linked to the repository
- **THEN** `lets-go` lists both titles and URLs, asks the user to unlink the extras, claims nothing and stops

#### Scenario: The rule is in the section
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads `lets-go`
- **THEN** *Read the settings* holds the Project query, and no part or procedure holds `no-project` or `several-projects`

### Requirement: Each lets-go procedure returns a result
Each section under `## Procedures` in `lets-go` SHALL end by returning to the part that ran it, with a result. A procedure SHALL not tell the agent to stop, and SHALL not name the part that runs next: the part that ran it decides. Outside code, a procedure's text, its subsections included, SHALL not hold the word `stop` or `stops`, in any case. A procedure that can end more than one way SHALL list its results. Each result is a name in backticks, with when it is returned and what it carries, such as the issue, who has it, or what to tell the user. The results SHALL be these:

| Procedure | Results |
|---|---|
| *Find the source of demand* | `found`, `unresolved`, `matches`, `no-match`, `picked`, `nothing-ready` |
| *Confirm the packet* | `complete`, `needs-shape`, `epic` |
| *Check the prerequisite* | `resolved`, `unresolved` |
| *Check the checkpoint* | `verified`, `checkpoint-failed`, `unresolved` |
| *Glossary preflight* | `no-owned-edits`, `verified`, `unresolved`, `checkpoint-failed` |
| *Claim* | `claimed`, `taken`, `unresolved`, `checkpoint-failed`, `branch-failed` |
| *Import the glossary checkpoint* | `imported`, `import-failed` |

*Glossary preflight* returns `no-owned-edits` when the story owns no glossary edits, and otherwise passes on what *Check the checkpoint* returns. `verified` carries the checkpoint commits to import. *Claim*'s `claimed` carries what *Glossary preflight* returned, so *Enter the branch* runs *Import the glossary checkpoint* only after `verified`. *Commit the discovery map* ends one way only, so it names no result.

#### Scenario: Every procedure returns
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads each procedure of `lets-go`
- **THEN** each one says it returns to the part that ran it, has no `Next:` line, and holds no `stop` or `stops` outside code

#### Scenario: A procedure that stops
- **WHEN** a skills folder holds `lets-go/SKILL.md` whose *Confirm the packet* says ``Say to run the `lets-shape` skill on `#<i>`, and stop.``
- **THEN** the check fails, and its output names `Confirm the packet`

#### Scenario: Confirm the packet lists its results
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Confirm the packet*
- **THEN** it finds `complete`, `needs-shape` and `epic`

### Requirement: Each part names the action for each result
A part that runs a procedure SHALL name each result the procedure can return there. For each one, it SHALL say what to do: go on, run another part, or tell the user what the result carries and stop. A part SHALL not hold a catch-all such as `any other stop stands`. The overview's *Stops when* column SHALL name the results a part stops on.

#### Scenario: Check the issue acts on the packet's results
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Check the issue*
- **THEN** it finds `complete`, `needs-shape` and `epic`, each with its action

#### Scenario: Enter the branch acts on the claim's results
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Enter the branch*
- **THEN** it finds `claimed`, `taken`, `unresolved`, `checkpoint-failed` and `branch-failed`, each with its action, and no `branch-exists`

#### Scenario: A claim with owned glossary edits
- **WHEN** *Glossary preflight* returns `verified` with two checkpoint commits, and *Claim* then returns `claimed`
- **THEN** *Enter the branch* runs *Import the glossary checkpoint* with those two commits before it commits the discovery map

#### Scenario: A claim with no owned edits
- **WHEN** *Glossary preflight* returns `no-owned-edits`, and *Claim* returns `claimed`
- **THEN** *Enter the branch* runs no import

#### Scenario: An epic stops the run
- **WHEN** the user runs `lets-go` for `#194`, and *Confirm the packet* returns `epic`
- **THEN** `lets-go` says that an epic is built through its stories, lists its open sub-issues, claims nothing and stops

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A done report is checked against its record
After a `done` report from plan, review plan, build or review build, the walk SHALL run that row's done test again, with the same reads and the same disagreement rules, before it prints the step's line. When the test says the step is done, the walk SHALL print the step's `Done` line and go on. When the records disagree, `lets-go` SHALL stop as *Records that disagree stop the run* says. When the test says the step is not done, the step SHALL count as failed. `lets-go` SHALL print its `Failed` line, whose reason starts `the step reported done, but` and names the record and what it holds, and end the walk as for a `failed` report. It SHALL not run the step again. A shape step's `done` report SHALL need no check of its own, because *Check the issue* runs *Confirm the packet* after it, and a second `needs-shape` stops the run.

#### Scenario: Plan reports done on a blocked change
- **WHEN** the plan step reports `done`, and `openspec instructions apply --change lets-go-chore --json` then says `blocked`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints a line that starts `Failed plan: the step reported done, but` and names the state `blocked`, prints no `Done plan:` line, and runs no review plan

#### Scenario: Review plan reports done with no section
- **WHEN** the change's `.openspec.yaml` says `schema: lets-standard`, the review plan step reports `done`, and pull request #167's body still has no **Plan review** section
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints a line that starts `Failed review plan: the step reported done, but` and names the missing **Plan review** section, and runs no build

#### Scenario: Review build reports done on a draft
- **WHEN** the review build step reports `done`, the archive folder exists, and pull request #167 is still a draft
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Records disagree:`, names the draft, and prints no `Done review build:` line

#### Scenario: A report the records agree with
- **WHEN** the build step reports `done`, and the state is then `all_done`
- **THEN** `lets-go` prints `Done build:` with the report's date and evidence, and goes on to review build

### Requirement: Each lets-go rule is written once
Each of these rules SHALL be written in one place in `lets-go`. Every other place that uses it SHALL link to it or name it, and SHALL not restate it.

- The interactivity level, in *Set the level*.
- The form of each step's `Done`, `Skipped` and `Failed` line, and how `<date>` and `<evidence>` are filled, in one section.
- The branch check, in *Check the issue*.
- The Project query and its two stops, in *Read the settings*.
- The prerequisite check, in *Check the prerequisite*.
- The packet check, in *Confirm the packet*.
- Each step's done test, in the walk.

A rule written once MAY run more than once. `next` runs *Check the prerequisite* and *Confirm the packet* on each candidate, and *Check the issue* runs both again for the picked issue. *Claim*'s *Glossary preflight* SHALL run only *Check the checkpoint*, which runs *Check the prerequisite* again only when the owner of the glossary definitions or the proposed base has changed. *Find the source of demand* SHALL not say that it returns to *Claim*, because *Claim* never runs it.

#### Scenario: Each line form is written once
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads `lets-go`
- **THEN** it finds `Done shape: <date>. <evidence>` and `Skipped shape: #<i>'s packet is complete, last edited <date>.` once each

#### Scenario: Claim looks for no branch
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Claim* in `lets-go`
- **THEN** it finds no `branch-exists`, and no branch lookup

#### Scenario: The preflight in Claim checks no prerequisite first
- **WHEN** `lets-go` runs *Claim* for #152, whose **Glossary handoff** names #150 as the owner of its definitions, #150's pull request has merged, and neither the owner nor the base has changed since *Check the issue*
- **THEN** *Claim* runs *Check the checkpoint* only when #152 owns the edits, and does not run *Check the prerequisite* again

#### Scenario: No return to Claim
- **WHEN** the skill-interfaces test reads *Find the source of demand*
- **THEN** it does not say `When *Claim* ran it, return to *Claim*`
